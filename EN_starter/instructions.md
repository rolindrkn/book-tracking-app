You are asked to build an app called RestfulReading, which will allow users to keep track of the books they are reading/have read.

Your job is to create the Book class, and to populate the development database with three or four books to make sure the interface works properly — you will be working with the provided Book.js file.

The Book class must have the following fields:

title - string - title of the book
author - string - author of the book
description - string - description of the book
pages - number - total number of pages
currentPage - number - page the user is currently on (between 1 and pages)
read - boolean - whether the user has read the book or not (default: false)
The Book class must also have the following instance method:

readBook(page)
allows the user to say which page they are currently on
if the page argument is less than one or more than the total number of pages of the book, readBook must return 0
if the page argument is greater than or equal to 1 and less than the total number of pages of the book, readBook must set the instance's currentPage field to the value passed as an argument and return 1
if the page argument is equal to the total number of pages of the book, readBook must set the instance's currentPage field to the value passed as an argument, set the instance's read field to true, and return 1
Once you have created the Book class, you will create at least three valid instances of it and place them inside the exported books Array. To check your work, refresh the integrated browser: your Book instances should be visible in the carousel of the RestfulReading interface.

To test your readBook instance method, you must follow these instructions for three books (without refreshing the page):

update the current page with a valid page that is less than the total number of pages
update the current page with the exact total number of pages (the book should disappear from the carousel and appear in the "Read" list)
Once you have achieved this, your browser should display an alert containing a single word. That word is the answer to the only question in the quiz!
